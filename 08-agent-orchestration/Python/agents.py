# Note: Lab Completed 9/20/2025
# Instruction: https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-agents/blob/main/Instructions/05-agent-orchestration.md
# -----------------
# Using the sequential orchestration pattern in the Semantic Kernel SDK, 
# to break down a problem -> route it through the right agents -> actionable results
# -----------------
# Develop a simple pipeline of three agents that work together to process 
# customer feedback and suggest next steps. 
# - Summarizer agent will condense raw feedback into a short, neutral sentence.
# - Classifier agent will categorize the feedback as Positive, Negative, or a Feature request.
# - Recommended Action agent will recommend an appropriate follow-up step.

        name="SummarizerAgent",

        Summarize the customer's feedback in one short sentence. Keep it neutral and concise.
        Example output:
        App crashes during photo upload.
        User praises dark mode feature.
        """,

    )   

    # Create a classifier agent
    classifier_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(
        name="ClassifierAgent",
        instructions="""
        Classify the feedback as one of the following: Positive, Negative, or Feature request.
        """,

    )    

    # Create a recommmended action agent
    action_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(
        name="ActionAgent",
        instructions="""
        Based on the summary and classification, suggest the next action in one short sentence.
        Example output:
        Escalate as a high-priority bug for the mobile team.
        Log as positive feedback to share with design and marketing.
        Log as enhancement request for product backlog.

    I tried updating my profile picture several times today, but the app kept freezing halfway through the process. 
    I had to restart it three times, and in the end, the picture still wouldn't upload. 
    It's really frustrating and makes the app feel unreliable.
